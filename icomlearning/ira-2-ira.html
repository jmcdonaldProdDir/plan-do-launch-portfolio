                    <p>I am pleased to recommend rolling your current IRA investments to a new IRA. As part of evaluating this Rollover, relevant costs, services and overall fit have been assessed. Please see below for a detailed review of this analysis and important disclosures about what you can expect.</p>
                    <h2>Rationale to Rollover your IRA <br></h2>
                    <p>To assess whether the recommendation to rollover your current IRA is appropriate for you, we analyzed how your IRA’s current situation compares to rolling over the assets to an IRA managed by your financial professional.</p>
                    <p>The analysis is derived from three categories, Fit, Service and Costs. Fit compares how the various features of both IRAs meet your unique circumstances and needs. Service assesses the importance of service offerings, e.g., financial planning, and compares the current IRA with an IRA plan managed by your financial professional. Finally, we compare how Investment Costs differ between the two IRAs.</p>
                    <p>The context of this comparison is limited to rolling your assets from the current IRA to a new IRA. It does not consider other potential investment choices, such as cashing out your existing IRA. Please speak with your financial professional if you would like to evaluate other options.</p>
                    <h2>Summary Chart<br></h2>
                    <p>The scores and results in the Summary Chart and the Assumptions tables are based on Client input.</p>
                    <p><strong>The services summary</strong> shows how the services offered by our firm meet your unique requirements when compared with your existing plan. The score on each line is a value from zero to ten, ten being the highest.</p>
                    <p><strong>The fit summary</strong> shows how well the features in our recommendation meet your circumstances and needs. The score on each line is a value from zero to ten, ten being the highest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Total Costs Summary</strong> shows how the costs of your current plan compare to the costs of your target plan/IRA. The values displayed are actual costs per $1,000.</p>

                        <p>The principal conflict of interest Acme Fiinancial has in making an IRA rollover recommendation is that Acme Fiinancial will make money if you do a rollover to an Acme Fiinancial IRA and will not make money if you do not. Acme Fiinancial can make money in various ways, depending on how you invest your rollover money at Acme Fiinancial. For example, if you choose to:<br></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Invest in stocks or ETFs; Acme Fiinancial charges no commission on most trades but can make money on routing your trade orders to third parties that make payments to it for order flow.</li>
                            <li>Invest in mutual funds, Acme Fiinancial may not charge you a commission, but the fund likely will make payments to Acme Fiinancial for shareholder services and other activities.</li>
                            <li>Invest in a portfolio managed by Acme Fiinancial; you will not pay any portfolio transaction charges but will pay management fees to Acme Fiinancial.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 style="/*margin-top: 50px;*/">Conflict of Interest - Financial Professional<br></h2>
                        <p>An Acme Fiinancial Financial Professional making an IRA rollover recommendation has a similar conflict. The Financial Professional can make additional money if you accept a recommendation to do a rollover. Please note that if you accept a rollover recommendation and do it at Acme Fiinancial, the Financial Professional will get credit for the new assets and may receive related compensation. Acme Fiinancial has policies, procedures, and supervision to mitigate the conflict.<br></p>

                    <h2>Your Options</h2>
                    <p>In general, you have three options for your retirement assets held in an IRA: </p>
                    <h3>OPTION 1: ROLL RETIREMENT SAVINGS FROM AN EXISTING IRA INTO A NEW IRA </h3>
                    <p>Rolling your money into an IRA allows your assets to continue their tax-advantaged status and growth potential, the same as in your employer's IRA. An IRA lets you decide how you want to manage your investments, whether using an online account with which you can choose investments on your own or working with a professional who can help you choose from investment options. </p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investments retain tax-deferred growth potential, as in your current IRA. </li>
                        <li>You may have access to a greater variety of investment choices, which may provide potential diversification. </li>
                        <li>You have the ability to maintain your savings along with your accounts and have them managed by one professional. </li>
                        <li>Additional contributions are allowed if eligible. </li>
                        <li>Under some circumstances, you may take penalty-free IRA distributions before age 59½. </li>
                        <li>Traditional and Roth IRA contributions and earnings are protected from creditors in federal bankruptcy proceedings to a maximum limit of $1 million, adjusted periodically for inflation.</li>
                        <li>Rollovers from qualified plans, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs have no maximum limit for federal bankruptcy protection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                    <p>Investment expenses for an IRA are generally higher than those in your employer’s retirement plan and depend mainly on your investment choices. These expenses may include sales commissions or other sales charges, management or other expenses charged by sponsors of investment products such as mutual funds or annuities, account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, and others. You should consult with your tax professional and your retirement plan administrator to understand the fees and expenses charged by your current plan and compare those with the expenses you would incur if your retirement savings were held in an IRA.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to have your retirement savings managed by an investment professional on a continuous basis, you may have the option of establishing an investment advisory account. These accounts generally involve payment of fees from your retirement assets based on the value of your account. </p>
                    <p>Required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin on April 1, following the year you reach age 72, and annually thereafter. The aggregate amount of your RMDs can be taken from your Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs. Roth IRA accounts have no RMDs. </p>
                    <p>IRAs are generally subject to state creditor laws regarding malpractice, divorce, creditors outside of bankruptcy, or other types of lawsuits. Assets in an IRA may be reachable by your creditors under some circumstances. You should consult with a legal professional or tax professional about the law in your state of residence. </p>
                    <p>If you own securities issued by your employer in an employer-sponsored plan and your investment in these assets has increased in value, the difference between the price you paid (cost basis) and the stock’s increased price is referred to as Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA). Favorable tax treatment of the NUA is lost if rolled into an IRA. </p>
                    <p>In addition to ordinary income tax, distributions before age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty. </p>
                    <p>If you choose to roll over your assets into an IRA, our firm can offer you recommendations about investments and alternatives. Other institutions offer similar services, including securities brokerage firms, banks, and investment professionals. You should consider the fees and services that all types of financial professionals provide before making a decision. You’ll want to research the different types of accounts and where you would like to open an IRA. </p>
                    <h3>OPTION 2: LEAVE SAVINGS IN THE CURRENT IRA</h3>
                    <p>If you leave your retirement savings in the current IRA, you will continue to be subject to the IRA’s rules regarding investment choices, distribution options, and loan availability. You will also continue to pay any applicable fees and expenses.</p>
                    <h4>FEATURES</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No immediate action is required from you. For as long as the terms of the IRA allow it, you can leave your retirement savings in that IRA.</li>
                        <li>Assets retain their tax-deferred growth potential.</li>
                        <li>Most IRAs offer you the ability to leave your savings in your current IRA.</li>
                        <li>The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation may insure benefits up to government-imposed limits.</li>
                        <li>Favorable tax treatment may be available for employer securities that have NUA and are owned in the IRA.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>KEEP IN MIND</h4>
                    <p>In addition to ordinary income tax, any distributions you take before age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty. RMDs must be taken from each employer-sponsored IRA, including IRA Roth accounts. Aggregation is not allowed. If you choose this option, remember to periodically review your investments, carefully track associated paperwork and documents, and take RMDs (once you reach age 72 from each of your retirement accounts.</p>
                    <h3>OPTION 3: WITHDRAW YOUR MONEY</h3>
                    <p>In general, you can remove your retirement savings from an IRA anytime. With a few limited exceptions, all withdrawals from retirement IRAs are taxable as income to you in the year they are received. In addition, if you are under the age of 59½, there may be an additional tax equal to 10% of the distribution amount.<br></p>
                    <p>While withdrawing money from an IRA may sound attractive, carefully consider the financial consequences before making such a decision. The money you withdraw will be subject to a mandatory 20% federal tax withholding. If you absolutely must access the money, you may want to consider withdrawing only what you need until you can find other sources of cash. In addition, by withdrawing assets from your retirement IRA, you will lose the ability to have them grow tax-deferred.</p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>You have immediate access to your retirement money and can use it however you wish. <br></p>
                    <p>Although distributions from the IRA are subject to ordinary income taxes, penalty-free distributions can be taken if you are at least 55 years of age in the year you leave your company or if you are at least 50 years of age in the year you stop working as a public safety employee—applicable to certain local, state or federal employees such as police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, or air traffic controllers—and are taking distributions from a governmental defined benefit pension. Check with your current IRA provider to see if you are eligible.</p>
                    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                    <p>The distribution may be subject to federal, state, and local taxes unless rolled over to an IRA or another employer IRA within 60 days. Retirement may be delayed, or the amount you’ll have to live on later may be reduced.<br></p>
                    <p>If you must choose this option, you may want to consider withdrawing only a portion of your savings while keeping the remainder saved in a tax-favored account, such as an IRA. This can help reduce your tax liability while growing some of your savings for retirement at the same time. Once requested, receiving your final check in the mail may take a few weeks. Remember, your final check amount will reflect a 20% automatic withholding for federal taxes and any gains or losses due to market fluctuation. You’ll want to consider how you’ll cover any additional federal taxes due, along with state taxes and the possible 10% early-withdrawal penalty when filing your tax return for the year. </p>
