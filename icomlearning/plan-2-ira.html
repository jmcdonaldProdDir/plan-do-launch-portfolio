Then, it can use either an importance value or an average value: ie., services can be above average, average, below average, etc. or they can be very important, important, not important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proposed</strong>:&nbsp;This is a checkbox value. For each question, you can configure whether a service is available for the current plan, or not.&nbsp;</li>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Dear&nbsp;<code>[firstname]</code></h2>
                <p>I am pleased to recommend rolling your employer-sponsored plan to an IRA. As part of evaluating this recommendation, relevant investment costs, financial services and overall fit have been assessed. Please see below for a detailed review of this analysis and important disclosures about what you can expect.</p>
                <h2>Rationale to Rollover your Employer-Sponsored Plan<br></h2>
                <p>To assess whether the recommendation to rollover your employer-sponsored plan assets to an IRA is appropriate for you, we analyzed how your current situation in your employer-sponsored plan portfolio compares to rolling over the assets to an IRA managed by your financial professional.</p>
                <p>The analysis is derived from three categories, Service, Fit and Costs. Service assesses how service offerings that are important to you, e.g., financial planning, compare between the employer-sponsored plan and the IRA managed by your financial professional. Fit compares how the various features of the IRA and employer-sponsored plan meet your unique circumstances and needs. Finally, we compare how Investment Costs under the employer-sponsored plan differ from those in the IRA.</p>
                <p>The context of this comparison is limited to rolling your assets from the employer-sponsored plan to an IRA. It does not consider other potential investment choices, such as cashing out your current plan. Please speak with your financial professional if you would like to evaluate other options.</p>
                <h2>Summary Chart<br></h2>

                    <h2 style="/*margin-top: 50px;*/">Conflict of Interest - Acme Fiinancial<br></h2>
                    <p>The principal conflict of interest Acme Fiinancial Investments has in making a 401k plan rollover recommendation is that Acme Fiinancial Investments will make money if you do a rollover to an Acme Fiinancial Investments IRA and will not make money if you do not. Acme Fiinancial Investments can make money in various ways, depending on how you invest your rollover money at Acme Fiinancial Investments. For example, if you choose to:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Invest in stocks or ETFs; Acme Fiinancial Investments charges no commission on most trades but can make money on routing your trade orders to third parties that make payments to it for order flow.</li>
                        <li>Invest in mutual funds, Acme Fiinancial Investments may not charge you a commission, but the fund likely will make payments to Acme Fiinancial Investments for shareholder services and other activities.</li>
                        <li>Invest in a portfolio managed by Acme Fiinancial Investments; you will not pay any portfolio transaction charges but will pay management fees to Acme Fiinancial Investments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 style="/*margin-top: 50px;*/">Conflict of Interest - Financial Professional<br></h2>
                    <p>An Acme Fiinancial Investments Financial Professional making a 401k plan rollover recommendation has a similar conflict. The Financial Professional can make additional money if you accept a recommendation to do a rollover. Please note that if you accept a rollover recommendation and do it at Acme Fiinancial Investments, the Financial Professional will get credit for the new assets and may receive related compensation. Acme Fiinancial Investments has policies, procedures, and supervision to mitigate the conflict.<br></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>

                </section>
                <h2>Your Options</h2>
                <p>In general, you have three options for your retirement plan assets when you leave your employer or have another qualifying event: </p>
                <h3>OPTION 1: ROLL RETIREMENT SAVINGS FROM EMPLOYER PLAN INTO AN IRA </h3>
                <p>Rolling your money into an IRA allows your assets to continue their tax-advantaged status and growth potential, the same as in your employer's plan. In addition, an IRA often gives you access to more investment options than are typically available in an employer's plan and personalized investment recommendations.</p>
                <p>An IRA lets you decide how you want to manage your investments, whether using an online account with which you can choose investments on your own or working with a professional who can help you choose from investment options.</p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investments retain tax-deferred growth potential, as in an employer-sponsored plan. </li>
                    <li>You may have access to more investment choices, which may provide potential diversification. </li>
                    <li>You can maintain your savings along with your accounts and have them managed by one professional. </li>
                    <li>Additional contributions are allowed if eligible. </li>
                    <li>Under some circumstances, you may take penalty-free IRA distributions before age 59 ½. </li>
                    <li>Traditional and Roth IRA contributions and earnings are protected from creditors in federal bankruptcy proceedings to a maximum limit of $1 million, adjusted periodically for inflation. </li>
                    <li>Rollovers from qualified plans, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs have no maximum limit for federal bankruptcy protection. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                <p>Investment expenses for an IRA are generally higher than those in your employer's retirement plan and depend mainly on your investment choices. These expenses may include sales commissions or other sales charges, management or other expenses charged by sponsors of investment products such as mutual funds or annuities, account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, and others. You should consult with your tax professional and your retirement plan administrator to understand the fees and expenses charged by your current plan and compare those with the expenses you would incur if your retirement savings were held in an IRA.</p>
                <p>If you choose to have your retirement savings managed by an investment professional on a continuous basis, you may have the option of establishing an investment advisory account. These accounts generally involve payment of fees from your retirement assets based on the value of your account.</p>
                <p>Required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin on April 1, following the year you reach age 72 and annually after that. The aggregated amount of your RMDs can be taken from your Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs. Roth IRA accounts have no RMDs.</p>
                <p>IRAs are generally subject to state creditor laws regarding malpractice, divorce, creditors outside of bankruptcy, or other types of lawsuits. Assets in an IRA may be reachable by your creditors under some circumstances. You should consult with a legal professional or tax professional about the law in your state of residence.</p>
                <p>If you own securities issued by your employer in an employer-sponsored plan and your investment in these assets has increased in value, the difference between the price you paid (cost basis) and the stock's increased price is referred to as Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA). Favorable tax treatment of the NUA is lost if rolled into an IRA.</p>
                <p>In addition to ordinary income tax, distributions before age 59 ½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty.</p>
                <p>If you choose to roll over your assets into an IRA, our firm can offer you recommendations about investments and alternatives. Other institutions offer similar services, including securities brokerage firms, banks, and investment professionals. You should consider the fees and services that all types of financial professionals provide before making a decision. You'll want to research the different types of accounts and where you would like to open an IRA.</p>
                <h3>OPTION 2: LEAVE SAVINGS IN EMPLOYER SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLAN </h3>
                <p>Most employer-sponsored retirement plans allow you to leave your retirement savings in their plan after you terminate your employment. If you leave your retirement savings in the employer's plan, you will continue to be subject to the plan's rules regarding investment choices, distribution options, and loan availability. You will also continue to pay any applicable fees and expenses.</p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No immediate action is required from you. For as long as the plan's terms allow, you can leave your retirement savings in that plan. </li>
                    <li>Assets retain their tax-deferred growth potential.</li>
                    <li>Most plans allow you to leave your savings in the current investment selections. </li>
                    <li>Fees and expenses are generally lower in an employer-sponsored plan than in an IRA, and you will continue to have access to those investment choices. Some employers may even pay administrative and other expenses associated with the plan. Check with your plan administrator for details on applicable fees and expenses. </li>
                    <li>Generally, you avoid the 10% IRS tax penalty on distributions from the plan if you leave the company in the year you turn 59½ or older (age 50 or older for certain public safety employees). </li>
                    <li>Employer-sponsored retirement plans have a greater degree of protection than IRAs from claims of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings and otherwise. Not all employer-sponsored plans have bankruptcy and/or creditor protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). </li>
                    <li>The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation may insure benefits up to government-imposed limits. </li>
                    <li>Favorable tax treatment may be available for employer securities that have NUA and are owned in the plan. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                <p>Your former employer may not allow you to keep your assets in the plan.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you choose to leave your assets in the employer-sponsored plan, you must maintain a relationship with your former employer for so long as your retirement savings stay in the plan. The former employer's plan will determine when and how you access your retirement savings, which investment options are available, and the fees and expenses you will pay. </p>
                <p>Additional contributions to the employer-sponsored plan are generally not allowed after employment termination. RMDs from your former employer's plan must be taken by April 1, following the year you reach age 72 and continue annually thereafter to avoid IRS penalties.</p>
                <p>In addition to ordinary income tax, any distributions you take before age 59 ½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty. RMDs must be taken from each employer-sponsored plan, including plan Roth accounts. Aggregation is not allowed. If you choose this option, remember to periodically review your investments, carefully track associated paperwork and documents, and take RMDs (once you reach age 72 from each of your retirement accounts.</p>
                <h3>OPTION 3: WITHDRAW YOUR MONEY</h3>
                <p>In general, you can remove your retirement savings from an employer-sponsored plan at any time. With a few limited exceptions, all withdrawals from retirement plans are taxable as income to you in the year they are received. In addition, if you are under 59 ½ years old, there may be an additional tax equal to 10% of the distribution amount.</p>
                <p>While withdrawing money from a retirement plan account may sound attractive, carefully consider the financial consequences before making such a decision. The money you withdraw will be subject to a mandatory 20% federal tax withholding. If you absolutely must access the money, you may want to consider withdrawing only what you need until you can find other sources of cash. In addition, by withdrawing assets from your retirement plan, you will lose the ability to have them grow tax-deferred.</p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <p>You have immediate access to your retirement money and can use it however you wish.</p>
                <p>Although distributions from the plan are subject to ordinary income taxes, penalty-free distributions can be taken if you are at least 55 years of age in the year you leave your company or if you are at least 50 years of age in the year, you stop working as a public safety employee applicable to certain local, state or federal employees such as police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, or air traffic controllers and are taking distributions from a governmental defined benefit pension or governmental defined contribution plan. Check with your plan administrator to see if you are eligible. Lump-sum distribution of appreciated employer securities may qualify for favorable tax treatment of NUA.</p>
                <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The distribution may be subject to federal, state, and local taxes unless rolled over to an IRA or another employer plan within 60 days. Your former employer is required to withhold 20% of any distribution you take in cash for the IRS.</li>
                    <li>Funds lose tax-deferred growth potential.</li>
                    <li>Retirement may be delayed, or the amount you'll have to live on later may be reduced.</li>
                    <li>If you leave your company before the year you turn 55 (or age 50 for certain public safety employees), you may owe a 10% IRS tax penalty on the distribution in addition to regular income tax.</li>
                    <li>If you must choose this option, you may want to consider withdrawing only a portion of your savings while keeping the remainder saved in a tax-favored account, such as an IRA. This can help reduce your tax liability while growing some of your savings for retirement at the same time. Once requested, it may take a few weeks to receive your final check in the mail. Remember, your final check amount will reflect the 20% automatic withholding for federal taxes and any gains or losses due to market fluctuation. You'll want to consider how you'll cover any additional federal taxes due, along with state taxes and the possible 10% early-withdrawal penalty when filing your tax return for the year.</li>
