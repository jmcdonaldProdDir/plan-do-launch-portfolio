                    <p>I am pleased to recommend rolling your current 401k plan to a new 401k plan. As part of evaluating this recommendation, relevant investment costs, financial services and overall fit have been assessed. Please see below for a detailed review of this analysis and important disclosures about what you can expect.</p>

                    <h2>Rationale to Rollover your 401k</h2>
                    <section></section>
                    <p>To assess whether the recommendation to rollover your current 401k plan is appropriate for you, we analyzed how your current situation in your 401k plan compares to rolling over the assets to a new 401k plan managed by your financial professional.<br></p>
                    <p>This analysis was derived from three categories, Fit, Service and Costs. Fit compares how the various features of both 401k plans meet your unique circumstances and needs. Service assesses the importance of service offerings, e.g., financial planning, and compares the current 401k plan with the 401k plan managed by your financial professional. Finally, we compare how Investment Costs differ between the two 401k plans.</p>
                    <p>The context of this comparison is limited to rolling your assets from the current 401k plan to a new 401k plan. It does not consider other potential investment choices, such as cashing out your current 401k plan. Please speak with your financial professional if you would like to evaluate other options.</p>

                    <h2 style="/*margin-top: 50px;*/">Conflict of Interest - InvestorCOM<br></h2>
                    <p>The principal conflict of interest InvestorCOM has in making a 401k plan rollover recommendation is that InvestorCOM will make money if you do a rollover to a InvestorCOM 401k plan and will not make money if you do not. InvestorCOM can make money in various ways, depending on how you invest your rollover money at InvestorCOM. For example, if you choose to:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Invest in stocks or ETFs; InvestorCOM charges no commission on most trades but can make money on routing your trade orders to third parties that make payments to it for order flow.</li>
                        <li>Invest in mutual funds, InvestorCOM may not charge you a commission, but the fund likely will make payments to InvestorCOM for shareholder services and other activities.</li>
                        <li>Invest in a portfolio managed by InvestorCOM; you will not pay any portfolio transaction charges but will pay management fees to InvestorCOM.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 style="/*margin-top: 50px;*/">Conflict of Interest - Financial Professional<br></h2>
                    <p>An InvestorCOM Financial Professional making a 401k plan rollover recommendation has a similar conflict. The Financial Professional can make additional money if you accept a recommendation to do a rollover. Please note that if you accept a rollover recommendation and do it at InvestorCOM, the Financial Professional will get credit for the new assets and may receive related compensation. InvestorCOM has policies, procedures, and supervision to mitigate the conflict.<br></p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Your Options</h2>
                    <p>In general, you have three options for your retirement plan assets when you leave your employer: </p>
                    <h3>OPTION 1: ROLL RETIREMENT SAVINGS FROM EMPLOYER PLAN INTO A NEW PLAN </h3>
                    <p>Rolling your money into a new 401k plan allows your assets to continue their tax-advantaged status and growth potential, the same as in your employer's plan.</p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investments retain tax-deferred growth potential, as in your current employer-sponsored plan. </li>
                        <li>You may have access to a greater variety of investment choices, which may provide greater potential diversification. </li>
                        <li>You have the ability to maintain your savings along with your accounts and have them managed by one professional. </li>
                        <li>Additional contributions are allowed if eligible.</li>
                        <li>Rollovers from qualified plans, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs have no maximum limit for federal bankruptcy protection. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                    <p>Transferring your 401k retirement money to another 401k may limit the creation of a well-diversified portfolio. Usually, you cannot invest in a publicly-traded company of your choice or buy cryptos through a 401k. Instead, you can only invest in a few handpicked mutual funds, index funds, and bonds.</p>
                    <p>A 401k gives participants limited control in managing their retirement money. When you move your funds to a 401k, the employer or plan administrator is fully responsible for managing the plan. Once you pick the preferred investment options from a list of preselected investments, the plan administrator determines how the plan is maintained.<br></p>
                    <p>When you move your funds to a new 401k plan, you may be required to pay higher investment fees. Usually, mutual funds charge expense ratios based on the total asset value. A small difference in the expense ratio of two different 401k could stretch into thousands of dollars in additional cost over time.</p>
                    <p>Depending on how you move your 401k money to the new 401k plan, you may trigger a taxable event. If you opt to receive a check from the former employer's 401k, you must transfer these funds into the new retirement account within 60 days. The former employer will withhold 20% of the transfer amount for federal income tax payment. You must come up with enough funds from other sources to cover the withheld amount and include it in your rollover contribution. If you don't meet the 60 days window, the transaction will be considered an early withdrawal, and you must report the transfer amount in your annual tax return. You will also incur an additional 10% penalty tax if you are below 59 ½. </p>
                    <h3>OPTION 2: LEAVE SAVINGS IN EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLAN</h3>
                    <p>Most employer-sponsored retirement plans allow you to leave your retirement savings in their plan after you terminate your employment. If you leave your retirement savings in the employer's plan, you will continue to be subject to the plan's rules regarding investment choices, distribution options, and loan availability. You will also continue to pay any applicable fees and expenses.</p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No immediate action is required from you. For as long as the plan's terms allow it, you can leave your retirement savings in that plan.</li>
                        <li>Assets retain their tax-deferred growth potential.</li>
                        <li>Most plans allow you to leave your savings in the current investment selections.</li>
                        <li>Fees and expenses are generally lower in an employer-sponsored plan, and you will continue to access those investment choices. Some employers may even pay administrative and other expenses associated with the plan. Check with your plan administrator for details on applicable fees and expenses. </li>
                        <li>Generally, you avoid the 10% IRS tax penalty on distributions from the plan if you leave the company in the year you turn 59½ or older (age 50 or older for certain public safety employees). </li>
                        <li>Employer-sponsored retirement plans have a greater degree of protection from claims of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings and otherwise. Not all employer-sponsored plans have bankruptcy and creditor protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). </li>
                        <li>The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation may insure benefits up to government-imposed limits.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Favorable tax treatment may be available for employer securities that have NUA and are owned in the plan.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Employer-sponsored retirement plans have a greater degree of protection from claims of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings and otherwise. Not all employer-sponsored plans have bankruptcy and creditor protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). </li>
                        <li>If you choose to leave your assets in the employer-sponsored plan, you must maintain a relationship with your former employer for so long as your retirement savings stay in the plan. The former employer's plan will determine when and how you access your retirement savings, which investment options are available, and the fees and expenses you will pay.</li>
                        <li>Additional contributions to the employer-sponsored plan are generally not allowed after employment termination.</li>
                        <li>RMDs from your former employer's plan must be taken by April 1, following the year you reach age 72 and continue annually thereafter to avoid IRS penalties.RMDs from your former employer's plan must be taken by April 1, following the year you reach age 72 and continue annually thereafter to avoid IRS penalties.</li>
                        <li>In addition to ordinary income tax, any distributions you take before age 59 ½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty.</li>
                        <li>RMDs must be taken from each employer-sponsored plan, including plan Roth accounts. Aggregation is not allowed. If you choose this option, remember to periodically review your investments, carefully track associated paperwork and documents, and take RMDs (once you reach age 72 from each of your retirement accounts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>OPTION 3: WITHDRAW YOUR MONEY</h3>
                    <p>In general, you can remove your retirement savings from an IRA at any time. With a few limited exceptions, all withdrawals from retirement IRAs are taxable as income to you in the year they are received. In addition, if you are under age 59 ½, there may be an additional tax equal to 10% of the distribution amount.</p>
                    <p>While withdrawing money from an IRA may sound attractive, carefully consider the financial consequences before making such a decision. The money you withdraw will be subject to a mandatory 20% federal tax withholding. If you absolutely must access the funds, you may want to consider withdrawing only what you need until you can find other sources of cash. In addition, by withdrawing assets from your retirement IRA, you will lose the ability to have them grow tax-deferred.</p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>You have immediate access to your retirement money and can use it however you wish.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Although distributions from the IRA are subject to ordinary income taxes, penalty-free distributions can be taken if you are at least 55 years of age in the year you leave your company, or if you are at least 50 years of age in the year you stop working as a public safety employee applicable to certain local, state or federal employees such as police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, or air traffic controllers and are taking distributions from a governmental defined benefit pension. Check with your current IRA provider to see if you are eligible.</p>
                    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>
                    <p>The distribution may be subject to federal, state, and local taxes unless rolled over to an IRA or another employer IRA within 60 days. Retirement may be delayed, or the amount you'll have to live on later may be reduced.</p>
                    <p>If you must choose this option, you may want to consider withdrawing only a portion of your savings while keeping the remainder saved in a tax-favored account, such as an IRA. This can help reduce your tax liability while growing some of your savings for retirement at the same time. Once requested, receiving your final check in the mail may take a few weeks. Remember, your final check amount will reflect the 20% automatic withholding for federal taxes and any gains or losses due to market fluctuation. You'll want to consider how you'll cover any additional federal taxes due, along with state taxes and the possible 10% early-withdrawal penalty when filing your tax return for the year.</p>
