Before creating          Plan → Do → Launch, he spent years inside organizations where onboarding lived in          people’s heads, processes changed weekly, and customers waited for clarity that never          quite arrived.        </p><p class="hero-text">          Today, John works with companies who are winning business but struggling to bring new          clients or staff on board smoothly. Through a clear, human-first approach, he helps          teams turn scattered knowledge, inconsistent workflows, and “hero-based” onboarding          into simple, repeatable systems that scale.        </p><p class="hero-text">          John’s background blends product leadership, onboarding design, regulatory expertise,          and AI-ready content strategy — giving him a unique ability to take something complex,          see the underlying structure, and rebuild it in a way that feels obvious in hindsight.        </p><p class="hero-text">          At his core, John believes that great onboarding isn’t just a process — it’s one of the          strongest competitive advantages a business can build.        </p><p class="hero-text">          He lives in London, Ontario and works with clients across Canada and the United States.        </p></div><aside><img class="img-fluid about-photo" src="assets/img/john-mcdonald.png" alt="John McDonald"></aside></section><footer class="footer"><div><span>© 2025 Plan → Do → Launch.
